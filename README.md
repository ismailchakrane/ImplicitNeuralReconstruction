# ImplicitNeuralReconstruction

This repository is part of my Masterâ€™s Degree in Artificial Intelligence at Claude Bernard University
Lyon 1. It is based on practical work, focusing on reconstructing 3D shapes from point sets. Detailed instructions are available <a href="https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/julie.digne/cours/tp_inr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Traditional Reconstruction Approach

The first part of this work implements the Hoppe method [Hoppe 1992], a baseline for surface reconstruction. Key steps include:

1. Loading an oriented point cloud.
2. Building a k-d tree using `scipy.spatial.KDTree`.
3. Creating a 3D grid using `numpy`.
4. Computing the signed distance function (SDF) for each grid point.
5. Extracting the 0-level set (isosurface) using `mcubes.marching_cubes`.
6. Saving and visualizing the mesh using `mcubes.export_obj`.

These steps are implemented in `hoppe_squelette.py`.
The output mesh will be saved as `result_hoppe.obj` and can be visualized with 3D software like Blender.

## Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment

Use `conda` for example to manage a Python environment:

```bash
conda create -n tp_inr
conda activate tp_inr
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code

Run for example the Hoppe reconstruction script:

```bash
python hoppe_squelette.py
```
